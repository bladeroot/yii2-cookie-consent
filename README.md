Provides really easy alerting users about the use of
cookies on your site.

Cookie consent is required to comply with the [EU Cookie Law].

Additionally it detects if cookie is disabled in user's browser
and redirects user to predefined page.

Works by adding Behavior to the Application View.
Behavior listens to [EVENT_END_BODY] and echos the consent script.
